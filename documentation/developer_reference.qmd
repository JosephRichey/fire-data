## Database
The database is designed to be a MySQL database hosted on AWS. A breakdown of th tables follows:

### Base Tables
These tables are used throughout the app. They are cross functional with the main four areas (training, incident, equipment, personnel) of the platform.

___

#### Firefighter
**Purpose:**
Stores the core personnel records for all firefighters within the department. Contains status (active/inactive), role, and other essential information.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier for each firefighter.

full_name (VARCHAR(511)) – The firefighter’s full name.

start_date (DATE) – The official start (hire) date.

trainer (BOOLEAN) – Indicates whether this firefighter can lead trainings.

officer (BOOLEAN) – Indicates whether this firefighter holds an officer rank.

active_status (BOOLEAN) – True if actively employed/engaged, false if deactivated or inactive.

company_id (INT, FK → company(id)) – Links the firefighter to a specific crew/company.

firefighter_role (VARCHAR(255)) – Descriptive role or title (e.g., Firefighter, Captain, etc.).

**Deletion:**

In practice, firefighters are not deleted but toggled inactive (active_status = false).

The FK to company uses ON DELETE SET NULL, so if a company is removed, the company_id here becomes NULL. They will be orphaned from a company.

Similarly, in chain of command, if a firefighter is removed, the FK to firefighter_id uses ON DELETE SET NULL. They will be orphaned in the chain of command.

**Joins:**

firefighter ↔ company on company_id (one company can have many firefighters).

Referenced by many tables via firefighter_id (e.g., chain_of_command, firefighter_contact, attendance, etc.).

___

#### Apparatus
**Purpose:**
Represents a piece of firefighting apparatus (e.g., Engine 1, Ladder Truck). Tracks which vehicles/resources are active and available.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier for each apparatus.

apparatus_name (VARCHAR(255)) – Official or commonly used name/label.

apparatus_expire (DATE) – Date after which the apparatus is considered “retired” or otherwise not available for new assignments.

**Deletion:**

Typically not deleted if used historically. Instead, the apparatus_expire field indicates it is no longer active.
List is managed in the settings tab.

**Joins:**

Referenced in tables such as equipment (equipment can be assigned to an apparatus), apparatus_response, and firefighter_apparatus.

#### Setting

**Purpose:**
Stores configurable keys and values for various features or behaviors within the platform (system‐wide or departmental settings).The value type allows the value to be parsed correctly. Note, all keys that have the same name have to have the same type. When parsing multiple values(like dispatch codes), the value type is set to the first record.
See [Setting Reference](setting_reference.qmd) for more details.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier.

domain (VARCHAR(255)) – The domain or area of the setting (e.g., “training,” “incident”).

setting_group (VARCHAR(255)) – Broad group of the setting.

setting_key (VARCHAR(255)) – Sub‐key or a more specific setting name.

setting_value (VARCHAR(255)) – The stored value.

value_type (VARCHAR(255)) – Type of value (e.g., “string,” “int,” “boolean”).

**Deletion:**

Typically, you might delete old or unused settings. No special constraints beyond the primary key.

**Joins:**

Not usually joined to other tables. Accessed by the application to retrieve configuration.

___

### Incident Tables
These tables are used to track incidents, responses, and related details.

___

incident ↔ incident_unit (tracks which type of response was needed).

___

#### Response

**Purpose:**
Represents an actual response instance tied to an incident (e.g., engine 1 responded). Typically, most incidents will only have one response (a response can have multiple firefighters, apparatus, etc.) An example of a mulit-response incident would be a wildland fire where one crew responded for the first 12 hours, and a second crew took over for the next 12 hours.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier for each response.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier.

unit_type (VARCHAR(255)) – Name/category (e.g., “Fire”, “EMS”, etc.).

unit_expire (DATE) – When this unit type is no longer considered active for new usage.

**Deletion:**

Typically not removed; once expired, it should not be used for new incidents.

**Joins:**

unit ↔ incident_unit (many incidents can reference each unit type).

___

#### Incident Unit

**Purpose:**
Links an incident to the type of unit (e.g., Fire, EMS, Rescue) that responded.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier.

incident_id (INT, FK → incident(id)) – The incident.

unit_type_id (INT, FK → unit(id)) – The type of unit that responded.

**Deletion:**

Typically retained for historical reference. ON DELETE RESTRICT means you cannot remove an incident or unit if references exist here.

**Joins:**

incident_unit ↔ incident.

incident_unit ↔ unit (one incident can have several types of units needed).

_This application tracks unit type response separately from apparatus because, in many volunteer departments, apparatus are often used simply to transport personnel. In these cases, it's important to record the type of response unit (e.g., EMS, fire, rescue) independently from the specific vehicle used._
