## Database
The database is designed to be a MySQL database hosted on AWS. A breakdown of th tables follows:

### Base Tables
These tables are used throughout the app. They are cross functional with the main four areas (training, incident, equipment, personnel) of the platform.

A note on naming- is_deleted is used when something should be deleted, but is retained for audit (think things like trainings). is_active is used for things that can change over time (dispatch codes and firefighters). is_deleted is always a date so there's a record of when it was deleted, and is_active is a boolean.


___

#### Firefighter
**Purpose:**
Stores the core personnel records for all firefighters within the department. Contains status (active/inactive), role, and other essential information.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier for each firefighter.

full_name (VARCHAR(511)) – The firefighter’s full name.

start_date (DATE) – The official start (hire) date.

trainer (BOOLEAN) – Indicates whether this firefighter can lead trainings.

officer (BOOLEAN) – Indicates whether this firefighter holds an officer rank.

is_active (BOOLEAN) – True if actively employed/engaged, false if deactivated or inactive.

company_id (INT, FK → company(id)) – Links the firefighter to a specific crew/company.

firefighter_role (VARCHAR(255)) – Descriptive role or title (e.g., Firefighter, Captain, etc.).

**Deletion:**

In practice, firefighters are not deleted but toggled inactive (active_status = false).

The FK to company uses ON DELETE SET NULL, so if a company is removed, the company_id here becomes NULL. They will be orphaned from a company.

Similarly, in chain of command, if a firefighter is removed, the FK to firefighter_id uses ON DELETE SET NULL. They will be orphaned in the chain of command.

**Joins:**

firefighter ↔ company on company_id (one company can have many firefighters).

Referenced by many tables via firefighter_id (e.g., chain_of_command, firefighter_contact, attendance, etc.).

___

#### Apparatus
**Purpose:**
Represents a piece of firefighting apparatus (e.g., Engine 1, Ladder Truck). Tracks which vehicles/resources are active and available.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier for each apparatus.

apparatus_name (VARCHAR(255)) – Official or commonly used name/label.

is_active (DATE) – Date after which the apparatus is not in use or otherwise not available for new assignments.

**Deletion:**

Typically not deleted if used historically. Instead, the apparatus_expire field indicates it is no longer active.
List is managed in the settings tab.

**Joins:**

Referenced in tables such as equipment (equipment can be assigned to an apparatus), apparatus_response, and firefighter_apparatus.

#### Setting

**Purpose:**
Stores configurable keys and values for various features or behaviors within the platform (system‐wide or departmental settings).The value type allows the value to be parsed correctly. Note, all keys that have the same name have to have the same type. When parsing multiple values(like dispatch codes), the value type is set to the first record.
See [Setting Reference](setting_reference.qmd) for more details.

**Column Definitions:**

id (INT, PK) – Unique identifier.

domain (VARCHAR(255)) – The domain or area of the setting (e.g., “training,” “incident”).

**Deletion:**

You might delete old or unused settings (not recommended). No special constraints beyond the primary key.

incident ↔ dispatch_code (many incidents can reference the same dispatch code).

___

#### Response

**Purpose:**
Represents an actual response instance tied to an incident (e.g., engine 1 responded). Typically, most incidents will only have one response (a response can have multiple firefighters, apparatus, etc.) An example of a mulit-response incident would be a wildland fire where one crew responded for the first 12 hours, and a second crew took over for the next 12 hours.

**Column Definitions:**

___

#### Incident Unit

**Purpose:**
Links an incident to the type of unit (e.g., Fire, EMS, Rescue) that responded.

**Column Definitions:**

**Joins:**

incident_unit ↔ incident.

incident_unit ↔ unit (one incident can have several types of units needed).

_This application tracks unit type response separately from apparatus because, in many volunteer departments, apparatus are often used simply to transport personnel. In these cases, it's important to record the type of response unit (e.g., EMS, fire, rescue) independently from the specific vehicle used._

## Time
Time has been a challenge in this application. The following is a summary of the structure of how it's handled.

### Storage and Manipulation

1. Datetime is always in UTC in the database in a datetime format.
```
format(dt,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "UTC", usetz = FALSE)
```
Use the format function when storing to ensure the correct format. Almost every time, the query is built and then executed rather than relying on dbAppend.

2. Anytime data is in memory in R, convert to local time zone in a POSIXct object
```
as.POSIXct(dt, tz = "UTC") |> with_tz("America/Denver")
```
3. When displaying value, convert to local time zone in a character string. This can either be a date, time, or datetime depending on the context.
```
format(dt, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "America/Denver", usetz = FALSE)
```
4. Dates are always stored in the database in a character string (no timezone, convert to local before storing)
```
format(dt, tz = 'America/Denver', "%Y-%m-%d", usetz = FALSE)
```
Dates retrieved from the database are converted to POSIXct obejcts when brought into memory. Tz doesn't matter, because there is no time element if it's just storing a date. Otherwise, see datetime guidelines.
```
as.Date(dt)
```
5. Utility Functions
Three helper functions in app/logic/functions.R simplify time handling across the app:

FormatLocal() – Formats a POSIXct object as a local string (date, time, or datetime). This is assuming you're going from R memory (POSIC local time zone) to a string (local time zone).

ConvertToLocalPosix() – Converts a UTC datetime string into local POSIXct and formats as a string. This is mainly for going from the database to R.

BuildDateTime() – Constructs a datetime from date + time input and returns a UTC or local POSIXct. Generally, it is used to build a UTC value that is stored in the database. The general flow of the applications has the database updated, and then reactives are invalidated and reloaded. This is the opposite of the other two functions, which are used to convert from the database to R memory.

These ensure consistent formatting, conversion, and safety.

### Flow
The flow of time in the application is as follows:
1. User inputs a date and time in local time (e.g., 2023-10-01 12:00:00).
2. The application converts this to a UTC datetime string for storage in the database.
3. The database stores this as a UTC date/datetime.
4. When retrieving data (either on initial load or on a refresh), the application converts the UTC datetime string back to a POSIX local time zone for stroage.
5. The application then formats the local time zone datetime for display to the user. This can be configured in the settings. See [Setting Reference](setting_reference.qmd) for more details.
