# fire-data
This is the main repository for all apps developed to be used together to track and report on administrative data in volunteer fire departments.

## cfd_data_portal
This is a personal project to push me in developing bslib and general shiny development skills. Additionally, this will serve as a useful tool for managing training hours for the Corinne Fire Department.

Currently, this app only supports the most basic functions (adding training and members, and very basic output of training data). Eventually, I plan to also incorporate features to modify check-in/check-out times, further analysis, more detailed automated reporting, and better classification methods for determining if someone receives credit for training.

In the future, this can also be developed further to track progress on recertification, call response, and other data that is useful and sometimes challenging for fire departments to track.
