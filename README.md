# Fire Data
This is the main repository for all apps developed to be used together to track and report on administrative data in volunteer fire departments. Check out the presentation for this project at [PositConf 2024](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf24/publiccatalog/page/publiccatalog/session/1711986858836001vnVj).

## Data Portal
This is the admin level app that allows for reporting, training and personal management, and soon managing and editing calls. Currently, the functionality is minimal. More coming soon.

Upcoming changes include:
	- Ability to modify check-in/check-out times 
	- An analysis and reporting pane 
	- Full functioning to edit trainings, attendance, etc.

## Training Attendance
This is the most tried and tested app currently. This allows people to check in and out of trainings for training hours. 

Upcoming features include:
	- A group clock out button (accessible via an admin password).
	- Color distinct modals that emphasize if you are checking in or out.

## Call Attendance
This is an exploratory app. The first version of this will be released in v0.3.0. This will allow departments to track who attended calls, what units were used, amount of time spent on the call, etc. This will eventually integrate with a backend automated server that can be set up to email reports with data and visuals as needed.

## Inventory
This is an exploratory feature. The general idea is a very lightweight inventory management app. This is still being scoped to see if it's a feasible project.
